    <h1>Augmented Reality : Smart shopping</h1>
    <h3 style="color: #1ab188" align="justify">The idea is to implement Augmented reality in shopping application. The
        project is planned in three increments.
        The app enhances the user shopping experience by finding the similar products based on color, brand etc.
        It shows the nearest stores and the products under it. The app also suggests the user regarding the suitabilty
        of the clothes based on the height and skin tone of the person. The app will require a user to login, in order
        to access the features of the app. Image recognition is used to find the similar products across the vendors
        which makes the shopping experience very easy.</h3>
